/**
 * This method is to find an element in a rotated sorted array.
 * And the array is originally sorted in increasing order.
 * Trick: No matter how many times the array is rotated, the array is 
 * divided into two increasing parts, except that the array is rotated back to its
 * original form, where there is only one increasing part that is the whole array.
