/**
 * This class file is to solve the problem of heavy pill.
 * The main idea is that we must distinguish bottle from bottle.
 * So we label each bottle from 1 to 20, and pick up the according
 * number of pills, that is for bottle 1, pick 1 pill, for bottle 2, pick
 * 2 pills and till to 20.
 * And at last, we compare the actual weight to the expected weight and 
 * get the difference to determine which bottle contains the heavier pill.
 * For this problem there is only analysis and no code part.
