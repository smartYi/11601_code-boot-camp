/**
 * This java file is to create a generic stack class with argument style T.
 * Stack is a data structure that supports FILO (First-in-last-out) operation ordering.
 * A regular Stack data structure usually includes these four operations:
 * pop(): Return and remove the top item from the stack;
 * push(item): Push the item to the top of the stack;
 * peek(): Return the item of the stack but do not remove it;
 * isEmpty(): Return true if and only if the Stack is empty.
 * In this well-designed stack, each sub-stack has a limitation capacity and if the sub-stack size
 * exceeds the limitation, another new sub-stack is created.
