/**
 * This class java file is to generate a simulation animal shelter.
 * This animal shelter only contains dogs and cats. People can adopt
 * one animal but the animal is restricted to the oldest animal of all 
 * animals or in the specific animal type. The age is based on the arrival
 * time, which means the first come-in animal must first out.
 * <p>
 * This character is quite the same as the queue, so an ainimal shelter
 * queue can be implemented for both dog and cat. And for any animals, 
 * a total queue is designed.
